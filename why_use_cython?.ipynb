    "# Why would I want to use Cython?\n",
    "Cython combines Python's easy of use with C performance to help developers optimize their Python (or create a fast Python interface to their C code). \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how Cython improves the performance of Python code, it is useful to have some knowledge of how code in Python and C is run. Python is a dynamically typed -- this means that variables do not have to be fixed at compile time, and a variable that starts as an `int` can be set to a `list` or even a custom Python object at any time. On the other hand, C is statically typed -- variable types must be defined at compile time, and they are generally that type and only that type. Also, Python is an interpreted language; this indicates that there is no compile step necessary to run the code. C is a compiled language, and files thus must be compiled before they are runnable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Python's nature as a dynamically typed, interpreted language, the interpreter must spend time to figure out what type each variable is at runtime, extract the data from these variables, run the low-level machine instructions, and then place the result into a (possibly new) Python object that is returned. In C, the compiler can figure out at compile time all the details of low-level functions / data to use; a compiled C program spends almost all its runtime calling fast low-level functions, making it much faster than Python. Cython attempts to improve the performance of Python programs by bringing the static typing of C to Python, a dynamic language.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few exceptions, valid Python code is also valid Cython. To demonstrate what sort of speed gains are possible with Cython, we turn to the classic example of calculating fibonacci numbers."

    "As you can see, it took Python 436 ns per loop to calculate `fibonacci(0)` and 4.89 µs per loop to calculate `fibonacci(70)`. Simply using Cython without any changes to the Python code more than doubled the performance, with 227 ns per loop to calculate `fibonacci(0)` and 2.1 µs per loop to calculate `fibonacci(70)`. However, the most dramatic performance increase came from using statically typed C variables (defined with `cdef`). Using statically typed variables resulted in 59.3 ns per loop when calculating `fibonacci(0)` and 126 ns per loop when calculating `fibonacci(70)`! In the case of calculating `fibonacci(0)`, this represents a 3x speed improvement over the naive Cython function and a 7x performance increase over the Python function. The speedup is even more pronounced when calculating `fibonacci(70)`; using statically typed variables gave a speedup of almost 17x from the naive Cython version and approximately a 39x improvement over the normal Python version!\n",

    "Cython gives massive performance achievements on this simple fibonacci example, but it's worth nothing that this example is completely CPU bound. The performance between Python and Cython on a memory bound program would likely still be noticeable, but definitely not as dramatic as this toy example."
